            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA) is a Government of India initiative designed to cultivate a spirit of innovation and scientific inquiry among school students from classes 6 to 12. Through hands-on learning experiences, teacher training programs, and collaborations with various stakeholders, RAA aims to foster creativity, problem-solving skills, and an interest in science, mathematics, and technology subjects. By providing infrastructure support, organizing competitions, and promoting experiential learning, RAA seeks to nurture the next generation of innovators and thinkers who can contribute to India's development and progress.</p>
            <h4>How to participate</h4>
            <p>To participate in the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA) scheme, schools and educational institutions typically need to follow certain guidelines and procedures set by the government. Here's a general outline of how schools can engage with the RAA initiative:</p>

This application may include details such as the school's name, address, contact information, number of students, and proposed activities or projects for participation in RAA.<br><br>4.) Compliance and Approval: The submitted applications are reviewed by the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with RAA guidelines and objectives. If the application meets the criteria, the school may receive approval to participate in the program.<br> <br>5.)Implementation: Upon approval, schools can start implementing RAA activities and projects as per the guidelines provided by the authorities. This may involve organizing experiential learning sessions, conducting teacher training programs, setting up innovation labs, and participating in competitions and exhibitions.<br><br>6.)Monitoring and Evaluation: Schools are expected to actively engage in RAA activities and regularly report their progress to the authorities. Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms may be in place to assess the impact of the program and ensure its effectiveness.</p>
