            <h4>Description</h4>
        <P>his initiative by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) aims to address the low representation of girl students in prestigious engineering institutions. It provides free online resources, tutorials, and mentoring to meritorious girl students to help them prepare for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for admission into Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other top engineering colleges.</p>
            <h4>How to participate</h4>
            <p>    Check Eligibility: The Udaan Scheme is typically open to girl students studying in classes XI and XII in CBSE affiliated schools. The specific eligibility criteria may vary slightly each year, so it's essential to check the official notification or announcement by CBSE.

                Registration: CBSE usually announces the registration process for the Udaan Scheme through its official website and other communication channels. Eligible students need to register themselves for the scheme during the specified registration period.
            
                Application Form: The registration process often involves filling out an online application form available on the CBSE Udaan portal. Students may need to provide personal details, educational qualifications, and other relevant information as required.
            
                Selection Process: After the registration period ends, CBSE may conduct a selection process to shortlist candidates for the Udaan Scheme. This selection process may include criteria such as academic performance, participation in previous science/mathematics competitions, etc.
            
                Notification of Selected Candidates: Once the selection process is complete, CBSE will notify the selected candidates through the official website or other communication channels. Selected students will receive further instructions on how to participate in the Udaan Scheme.
            
                Participation in Udaan Sessions: Selected students will have access to various online resources, tutorials, and mentoring sessions provided under the Udaan Scheme. They are expected to actively participate in these sessions to enhance their preparation for competitive exams like JEE.
            
                Regular Assessment and Feedback: Throughout the duration of the Udaan Scheme, participants may undergo regular assessments to track their progress. They may also receive feedback and guidance from mentors to help them improve their performance. <a href="https://www.education.gov.in/">"links for know more details.</a></p>
