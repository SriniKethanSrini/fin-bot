    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Atal Pension Yojana (APY) is a government-sponsored pension scheme aimed at providing a defined pension to citizens of India, especially those working in the unorganized sector. Launched by the Government of India in 2015, APY is administered by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).</p>
    
    <h2>How to Apply for the Scheme:</h2>
    <p>To apply for the Atal Pension Yojana (APY), eligible individuals aged between 18 to 40 years need to visit their respective bank branches with their Aadhaar card, PAN card, and address proof. At the bank, they should request an APY application form, which they need to fill out with personal details, nominee information, and their preferred pension amount. Along with the completed form, applicants must submit the required documents. They will also need to provide an auto-debit mandate to authorize the regular deduction of contributions from their savings account. Once the initial contribution is made, applicants will receive an acknowledgment receipt confirming their enrollment in the APY scheme.</p>
